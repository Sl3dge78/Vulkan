RENDERER:
    CRITICAL:
        - Resize the texture array, rebuild the pipeline?
        - Reloading the renderer doesn't reload the meshes and stuff
            ? Should we kill renderer hot reloading?
            - Mesh data (buffers, textures) prevents us from hot reloading
                ? Game could store all the loaded meshes and their instance data and send it back to the renderer on reload.
                ? Spliting the renderer in two (backend/frontend) could make it possible to reload the backend only.
                    > Frontend has mesh data and all and sends it to the backend on reload
                    > Backend is the current stuff
        - Dynamic array of meshes
            - Take a decision on frontend/backend first
        ? Split the way we store render data
            > Renderer has list of meshes
            > Game has pointer to these meshes and their xform info
                > To render, pack this all up and send it to the renderer
        - Make sure that we can load different GLTF, I think the mat id and tex id are hardcoded

    MAJOR:
        - Descriptor set 0 > could be the same for all pipelines
            > Could have the camera matrices and the shadowmap sampler

    BACKLOG:
        - Window Resize > Pipline dynamic states ?
        - Mipmaps
        - Volumetric clouds?
        - Have a look at vkCmdDrawIndirect
        - Maybe use rayquery for shadows?

    IMPROVEMENTS:
        - Can't create a scene without textures
        - IBL?
        - Utiliser des Staging buffers
        - Pipeline caches
        - Pick the device according to our specs
        - Pipeline dynamic state
        - Apparently we should only allocate big stacks of memory

GLTF:
    CRITICAL:
    MAJOR:
        - If we have multiple meshes that use the same primitve, right now we just duplicate it
        - Read embedded glb

    MAJOR:
    BACKLOG:
        - Should I make my own memory allocator?
        - Remove SDL?
            > We need it for input
                - More keys
                - Optimize keyboard entering, this is dumb
                - Mouse

        - In game console
