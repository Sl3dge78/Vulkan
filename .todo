RENDERER:
    CRITICAL:
        - Dyn array of meshes
        - Resize the texture array, rebuild the pipeline?
        - Make sure that we can load different gltf, i think the mat id and tex id ar hardcoded

    MAJOR:
        - Find a way to draw the sun even though no fragments are on the screen
            > Skybox, same render pass, different pipeline
            > Or switching the volumetric fog to a new pass should fix it
        - Descriptor set 0 > could be the same for all pipelines
        - Optimize volumetric fog
            > Move it to a new renderpass.
            > Will need the z-buffer and the shadowmap
            > What else? think about it. Currently in the shader it needs the world pos. How do i get it from the zbuffer? How do I get them along the ray? Should be fine

    BACKLOG:
        - Window Resize > Pipline dynamic states ?
        - Mipmaps
        - Volumetric clouds?
        - Have a look at vkCmdDrawIndirect
        - Maybe use indirect raytracing for shadows?

    IMPROVEMENTS:
        - Can't create a scene without textures
        - IBL?
        - Utiliser des Staging buffers
        - Pipeline caches
        - Pick the device according to our specs
        - Pipeline dynamic state
        - Apparently we should only allocate big stacks of memory

GLTF:
    CRITICAL:
    MAJOR:
        - If we have multiple meshes that use the same primitve, we will just dupe it here
        - Read embedded glb
